Getting Started
Note: Ensure you have Python and Django set up correctly before proceeding. Follow the official Django - Installation Guide to install the necessary tools.

Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
Make sure you have a Python virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. If you donâ€™t have one set up yet, create it:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Once the environment is activated, install the project dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Database Migrations
Django uses migrations to apply changes to your database schema. Run the following command to apply migrations and set up the database:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Step 3: Start the Django Development Server
With the environment set up and the database ready, you can now run the Django development server:

bash
Copy code
# Run the Django development server
python manage.py runserver
If everything is set up correctly, your server should be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open this URL in your browser to access the project.

Step 4: Modifying your Project
Now that you have successfully run the app, you can start modifying it:

Open the project folder in your text editor of choice.
Modify the app files in the shopapp directory or wherever your Django app files are located.
You can reload your browser to see the changes reflected immediately.

Step 5: Access the Admin Panel
If you want to manage the website content through the Django admin panel, make sure to create a superuser:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
After creating a superuser, you can log in to the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ using the credentials you just created.
