Getting Started 🚀
Note: Ensure you have Python and Django installed before proceeding. You can follow the official Django Installation Guide to set up your environment.

Step 1: Setting Up the Environment 🌐
Create a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Once the environment is active, install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Database Migrations 💾
Django uses migrations to apply changes to your database schema. Run the following command to apply migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Step 3: Start the Django Development Server 🖥️
Once the database is set up, you can start the Django development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
If everything is set up correctly, your server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open this link in your browser to access the project.

Step 4: Modifying Your Project 🔧
Now that you’ve successfully run the app, you can modify it by:

Opening the project folder in your text editor.
Editing files in the shopapp directory (or wherever your Django app files are located).
You can reload your browser to see any changes reflected immediately.

Step 5: Access the Admin Panel 🔑
To manage products, orders, and users via the Django Admin, you’ll need to create a superuser:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
After creating a superuser, log in to the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ with your new credentials.
